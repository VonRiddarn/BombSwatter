## About

THIS PROJECT IS A WIP!!!

This is a simple game created in Monogame.<br/>
It plays and functions a lot like the original Minesweeper for windows XP with a few quality of life improvements.<br/>
The game was made in order to learn more about the Monogame framework.

## How to use
Download, compile and run the code.<br/>
I might add the executeable at a later time.<br/>
