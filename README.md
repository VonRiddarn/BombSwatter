<p align="center">A not so original idea for a game!</p>

## About
This is a simple game created in Monogame.<br/>
It plays and functions a lot like the original Minesweeper for windows XP with a few quality of life improvements.<br/>
The game was made in order to learn more about the Monogame framework.<br/>
<br/>
### What the future holds
This project will forever remain a "work in progress", however since the release of this latest update I have learned and accomplished everything I set out to do.
The project will most likely not recieve any more major updates as I am intending on using this knowledge on my next (or next-next) project:
A (simple) game engine.<br/>
Should I go about to update the game I'll probably add: Menu - Choose difficulty, UI, Sounds

## How to play
Left mouse	:	Open a cell<br/>
Right mouse	:	Disarm or flag a cell<br/>
R			:	Restart the board (Takes a few seconds to load)<br/>
<br/>
Notice: Disarmed and flagged cells cannot be opened.<br/>

## How to use
Download, compile and run the code.<br/>
If you're on windows I provided the executeable in "Release_Windows"<br/>
To anyone else, sorry for the additional unnecessary files.
